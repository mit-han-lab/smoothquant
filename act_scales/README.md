# Activation Channel Scales

We provide the activation channel scales for OPT and BLOOM models at [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/smoothquant-scales). We get those scales with 512 random sentences in the Pile validation set. You can use `../examples/smoothquant_opt_demo.ipynb` to test smoothing and quantizing those models.
